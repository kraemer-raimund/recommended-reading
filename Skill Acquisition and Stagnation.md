# Skill Acquisition and Stagnation

### [How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/)

Erik Dietrich explains why a large number of software developers stagnate at a level which he calls the "Expert Beginner" stage. He compares it to his own journey of learning to bowl and playing in an amateur league: Becoming pretty decent, but capping out at a mediocre level, then having to learn to actually hold and throw the bowling ball properly in order to keep improving.

> "There’s nothing you can do to improve as long as you keep bowling like that. You’ve maxed out. If you want to get better, you’re going to have to learn to bowl properly."

He then gives a short summary of the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, which divides the journey from novice to expert into five stages: Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert.

> [...] the gist of it is that skill acquirers move from “dogmatic following of rules and lack of big picture” to “intuitive transcending of rules and complete understanding of big picture.”

He describes an additional stage, which he calls "Expert Beginner", in which Advanced Beginners hit a local maximum after they have learned the "low hanging fruit" of skills to acquire early on, and how it relates to the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), a cognitive bias leading beginners to largely overestimate their ability and knowledge compared to more competent individuals.

> [...] Advanced Beginners can break one of two ways: they can move to Competent and start to grasp the big picture and their place in it, or they can ‘graduate’ to Expert Beginner by assuming that they’ve graduated to Expert.

> The real shame of this is that a couple of inferences that aren’t entirely irrational lead me to a false feeling of achievement and then spur me on to opt out of further improvement. I go from my optimistic self-assessment to a logical fallacy as my bowling career continues: “I know that I’m doing it right because, as an expert, I’m pretty much doing everything right by definition.”
